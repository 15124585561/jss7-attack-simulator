# SS7 Attack Simulator based on RestComm's jss7.

## Introduction

Open Source Java SS7 attack simulator that makes it possible to simulate some publicly disclosed attacks on the SS7 network.

This project is part of an ongoing Master Thesis at NTNU Gj√∏vik, Norway.

The simulator supports two modes:

* Simple mode: Used to demonstrate some SS7 attacks.
* Complex mode: Includes a full network simulation containing 3 operators, where one of the subscribers is the victim of attacks by an adversary with access to the SS7 network.
  In this mode several nodes communicate using 13 standard procedures per the 3GPP MAP standard. After a mercy period, there will be launched attacks against the subscriber with the goal of obtaining the subscribers location and intercept SMS originally sent to this subscriber.

## Downloads

Builds can be downloaded from the project's [Jenkins CI Server](https://jensen.ninja/jenkins/).

## Instructions

How to run the simulator:

* Make sure you have SCTP support installed on Linux.
* Download latest build artifact from the projects [Jenkins CI Server](https://jensen.ninja/jenkins/job/jss7-attack-simulator/).
* Unzip the file.
* The simulator is launched with the script:

```
RELEASE_FOLDER/ss7/restcomm-ss7-simulator/bin/run.sh
```

* Run

``` 
run.sh help 
```

or

```
run.sh attack_simulation help 
```

for help on how to run the simulator.

The currently supported simple attacks are:

* location:ati
* location:psi
* intercept:sms
